Text::Format

format()        format text into a paragraph.  text is first broken into
                words and then joined back together to make up the
                paragraph.

paragraphs()    treats each element of the array passed in as a separate
                paragraph and passes them to format() for formatting.
                the list returned will be then formatted into separate
                paragraphs

center()        centers all the lines that were passed in.

expand()        expand tabs into spaces.

unexpand()      turn spaces into tabs.  first calls expand() to expand
                tabs into spaces and then turns tabstop number of spaces
                into tabs, you can set tabstop size with tabstop().
