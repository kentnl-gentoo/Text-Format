Revision history for Perl extension Text::Format.

0.44 Thu Feb 12 16:31:08 1998
    - added quotes to hash keys as 5.003 didn't like unquoted hash keys
      starting with an underscore

0.43 Sat Feb  7 14:55:39 1998
    - fixed some warnings that were occurring

0.42 Fri Feb  6 18:37:13 1998
    - no real changes as far as the user is concerned
    - changed some internal subroutines from being just a reference to
      being a real subroutine so Objects that inherit from Text::Format
      can use them

0.41  Mon Feb  2 22:57:33 1998
    - fixed non-breaking space bug
    - added some more error checking to new() and config()

0.40  Thu Jan 29 16:47:41 1998
    - added support for non-breaking space
    - made some changes that make the module incompatible with the
      previous version
      * firstIndent and bodyIndent now take a number as an argument and
        spaces are used for the indents at all times rather than the
        previously specified strings
      * expandTabs is gone - to expand tabs prior to using center()
        just use Text::Format->expand() first
      * subroutines wrap and fill renamed to format() and paragraphs()
        to reflect their usage
    - fixed the bug due to the right margin not being considered when
      doing right alignment

0.33  Wed Jan 21 17:50:39 1998
    - added left margin and right margin spec, left out by accident
      before

0.32  Sat Jan 17 11:45:48 1998
    - fixed another bug :-(

0.31  Fri Jan 16 17:23:18 1998
    - renamed module to Format.pm (was Manip.pm)
      fixed a warning; was operating on an undef'ed string without
      checking now check for defined strings

0.30  Wed Jan 14 22:20:37 1998
    - added ability to do hanging indents, fixed the interface for a
      better object oriented design, fixed some more bugs

0.23  Fri Jan 10 22:56:40 1998
    - few bug fixes

0.22  Fri Jan 10 17:39:23 1998
    - addition of expand/unexpand routines

0.21  Thu Jan  9 20:23:34 1998
    - addition of center routine

0.20  Wed Jan  8 22:20:28 1998
    - change to object oriented module

0.10  Tue Jan  6 15:28:29 1998
    - original version
      routines are : wrap, fill
      basically the same as Text::Wrap at this point just without the
      chance for dying, it's just a basic module - Andreas Koenig
      suggested to make it object oriented
